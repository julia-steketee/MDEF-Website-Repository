								<h2>Extended Intelligences Week 1 (with Taller Estampa)</h2>
                                 <br>
                                <h2>Wondering how this will apply to my own design practice</h2>
                                 <br>
                                <p>On the first day, I said to Anna. Damn, two weeks of Extended Intelligences. She sensed my frustration as in that moment I was thinking, how will this apply to my design and artistic practice? With our first design intervention assignment on the horizon, my mind was lost between the mycelial hyphae, one of nature’s most vast network and now, I would have to wrap my head around digital neural networks. I started out distracted and hesitant but Taller Estampa’s artistic approach to artificial intelligence started to reel me in. </p>

								<p>Despite their emphasis on tech and programming, Taller Estampa is the first exposure to fine art that we have had during the master. I come from an artistic background. I was not trained an industrial designer who receives design briefs and solves problems with distinct parameters, I would consider my education and personal practice more on the artistic end of the spectrum. Before embarking on this master’s program, I was working for a fine artist for 2 years. I see fine arts´ purpose as one to instigate conversation and a method to change one’s perspective. Unlike what design preaches, fine art does not solve anything, instead it brings topics, conversations and emotions to light. During this program, as a group of highly motivated and more or less optimistic group of creatives, we are eager to tackle, solve, and intervene. I too play this part, but I appreciated this momentary break as we spent some time with this collective of artists and developers, Taller Estampa. </p>
                                
                                <h2>Understanding Neural Networks</h2>
                                 <br>

								<p>In IBM’s words, “Neural networks reflect the behavior of the human brain, allowing computer programs to recognize patterns and solve common problems in the fields of AI, machine learning, and deep learning. Neural networks rely on training data to learn and improve their accuracy over time. However, once these learning algorithms are fine-tuned for accuracy, they are powerful tools in computer science and artificial intelligence, allowing us to classify and cluster data at a high velocity.”</p>

                            <h2>Understanding Google Co-labs</h2>

								<p>With Colab you can import an image dataset, train an image classifier on it, and evaluate the model, all in just a few lines of code.</p>

								<p>https://colab.research.google.com</p>
                                <p>I will add reflection and photos about the Latent Space Colab, Deep Fake Colab</p>
                                
                            <h2>Datasets and Biases</h2>
                                <p>The Latent space colab was trained using a Flickr data set of  people's faces. We also explored a colab called Metfaces which was trained on painted portraits.</p>
                                <p>The datasets are not representative of the worlds diverse population. The data se was very heavily white. When we would move the “strangeness” factor up (increase the characteristics that are less common in the data set) , we would often see an asian woman or an older man. This is likely because asian women and older men were less common in the original dataset. The least “strange” face was a white woman with brown hair and somewhat androgynous features. It is essential to consider how a dataset can lead to very biased outputs. There are countless examples of these biases in today’s machine learning software. A hiring company that was given data that had no information about gender or race was consistently choosing white male candidates because the machine learning software had learned that candidates with certain educational and professional backgrounds were desired and it was more common that white males checked these boxes. Because we live in an unequal society, whatever data that we give a neural network, it will reflect and sometimes emphasize this inequality.</p>

                                <h2>Feeling oversaturated </h2>
                            
                                <p>Throughout this masters course we have received a steady flow of inputs and haven’t been able to let the deluge of information absorb into our brains.  I came into this masters thirsty for new information. Now I am feeling quenched, ready to run a marathon before I take another sip. Because of my lack of experience with and the utter complexity of his week’s topic, I feel that I am scraping the surface. We simply do not have enough time to dive deeper into the inner-workings of neural networks or to understand what it takes to train one. Ideally, this class should have been a month long. But if I knew the masters was going to have a month long course in artificial intelligence, I likely would not have applied. I find the topic interesting to learn about but it is not on the top on my list of interests. I think I’d rather spend my time developing other skills. I also could probably say the same thing about the Bio and Agri zero module, it should have been a month long but other classmates might rather spend their time exploring different subjects. </p>
