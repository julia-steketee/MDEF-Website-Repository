                                <br>

                                <h2>How am I documenting?</h2>
                                <br>
                                <p>I find it very challenging to document my life. I am not a person who likes using Instagram. I believe my last Instagram was in 2019, about 2 years ago. I have stayed on the platform to be able to message people and follow artists, designers, friends, and organizations but I am a very infrequent user. Instagram is a fascinating and very effective tool but I don't like the headspace that I enter when scrolling through my feed. </p>
                                
                                <p>Documenting is something that I strive to improve on. By documenting, I organize my thoughts and find the logic amongst the chaos. But documenting all the time also seems to take precious time away from the actual act of what I am doing.</p>
                                
								<p>Currently, I think the most concrete form of measuring what I am doing is through lists. Since day 1 of the masters, my head is spilling over with ideas. Unfortunately, there is not really time to develop or execute these ideas but what I have been trying to do is simply write them down in different parts of my sketchbook and a digital note app.</p>
                                
                                <p>I am trying to advance some of these ideas and day by day I make lists of what I want to read, find on the street, research, or build.  These lists show my process in a very intimate way and it is a sort of documentation that is already integrated into my design process.</p>
                                
                                <p>During Kate's lecture on documentation, she asked: how can you turn documentation into something that feeds your design process?</p>
                                
                                <p>Perhaps a form of list-making could be a great way of showing this process in a way that will help my design process and not require heaps of extra time.My biggest challenge with documentation is that I feel that I cannot present my documentation process because I would have to re-write, edit or in effect "translate" it for an audience to make sense of it.  My hasty scribbles and stream of consciousness are scattered across different corners of my notebook and apps on my phone and computer and to present them into a comprehensible document takes extra time. Editing videos and photos sometimes feels like a burden when there are a million other priorities on my list.</p>
                                
                                <p>Although it takes time to edit and assemble, it helps me to organize my thoughts and keep me on track. Organizing documentation in a presentable format allows me to see my work from an outsider's perspective. Creating a digital "design space" has been beneficial for me to visit a place where I visually map my mental process. Here, I have begun listing my tools, infrastructures and spaces, and communities available to me, as well as selected weak signals from Mariana's workshop, and names, photos of artists, designers, initiatives, projects, and books that inspire me and my design practice. Secondly, when assembling the short clips of video that I had taken over the course of my "Living with your own ideas" intervention helped me to assemble the story around my process. I could identify the method amidst the madness of the day.</p>
                                
                                <p>In order to live with my own ideas, I decided to spend my day establishing a circular system in my apartment. List making was crucial to my practice that day. In my notebook, I also added quick comments about what was not working and what I needed to improve on. I spent the day organizing, cleaning, shredding my trash, and researching composting techniques and ideas of how to use my food residues and trash. This was not just a 1-day intervention, as specified as in the assignment. Instead, this would become my new lifestyle, a new challenge. I have continued on this journey and I haven't thrown out any trash (from my apartment since). I have started a compost but I am still waiting for the worms to come in the mail. I have also started to find ways to drastically reduce plastic and other materials from my lifestyle. I am now ordering my vegetables from a guy named Toni who works on a farm in Catalunya and delivers organic vegetables once a week to Barcelona. I have been buying other food in bulk at shops like Casa Perris. I have started to make my own oat milk because the Tetrapak boxes have been building up. The next step, is finding somewhere where I can buy milk in returnable glass bottles in order to make my own yogurt and kefir at home. Anyhow, this is an example of a project that is made possible by many digitally dynamic and vanishing paper lists. I think that one excellent way to document this process is to find a way to consolidate these lists into one and show their evolution. </p>
