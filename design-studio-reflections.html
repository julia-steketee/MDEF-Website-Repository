                                <p>November 14, 2021</p>
                                <br>
                                <h2>How am I documenting?</h2>
                                <br>
                                <p>I find it very challenging to document my life. I am not a person who likes using Instagram. I believe my last Instagram was in 2019, about 2 years ago. I have stayed on the platform to be able to message people and follow artists, designers, friends, and organizations but I am a very infrequent user. Instagram is a fascinating and very effective tool but I don't like the headspace that I enter when scrolling through my feed. </p>
                                
                                <p>Documenting is something that I strive to improve on. By documenting, I organize my thoughts and find the logic amongst the chaos. But documenting all the time also seems to take precious time away from the actual act of what I am doing.</p>
                                
								<p>Currently, I think the most concrete form of measuring what I am doing is through lists. Since day 1 of the masters, my head is spilling over with ideas. Unfortunately, there is not really time to develop or execute these ideas but what I have been trying to do is simply write them down in different parts of my sketchbook and a digital note app.</p>
                                
                                <p>I am trying to advance some of these ideas and day by day I make lists of what I want to read, find on the street, research, or build.  These lists show my process in a very intimate way and it is a sort of documentation that is already integrated into my design process.</p>
                                
                                <p>During Kate's lecture on documentation, she asked: how can you turn documentation into something that feeds your design process?</p>
                                
                                <p>Perhaps a form of list-making could be a great way of showing this process in a way that will help my design process and not require heaps of extra time.My biggest challenge with documentation is that I feel that I cannot present my documentation process because I would have to re-write, edit or in effect "translate" it for an audience to make sense of it.  My hasty scribbles and stream of consciousness are scattered across different corners of my notebook and apps on my phone and computer and to present them into a comprehensible document takes extra time. Editing videos and photos sometimes feels like a burden when there are a million other priorities on my list.</p>
                                
                                <p>Although it takes time to edit and assemble, it helps me to organize my thoughts and keep me on track. Organizing documentation in a presentable format allows me to see my work from an outsider's perspective. Creating a digital "design space" has been beneficial for me to visit a place where I visually map my mental process. Here, I have begun listing my tools, infrastructures and spaces, and communities available to me, as well as selected weak signals from Mariana's workshop, and names, photos of artists, designers, initiatives, projects, and books that inspire me and my design practice. Secondly, when assembling the short clips of video that I had taken over the course of my "Living with your own ideas" intervention helped me to assemble the story around my process. I could identify the method amidst the madness of the day.</p>
                                
                                <p>In order to live with my own ideas, I decided to spend my day establishing a circular system in my apartment. List making was crucial to my practice that day. In my notebook, I also added quick comments about what was not working and what I needed to improve on. I spent the day organizing, cleaning, shredding my trash, and researching composting techniques and ideas of how to use my food residues and trash. This was not just a 1-day intervention, as specified as in the assignment. Instead, this would become my new lifestyle, a new challenge. I have continued on this journey and I haven't thrown out any trash (from my apartment since). I have started a compost but I am still waiting for the worms to come in the mail. I have also started to find ways to drastically reduce plastic and other materials from my lifestyle. I am now ordering my vegetables from a guy named Toni who works on a farm in Catalunya and delivers organic vegetables once a week to Barcelona. I have been buying other food in bulk at shops like Casa Perris. I have started to make my own oat milk because the Tetrapak boxes have been building up. The next step, is finding somewhere where I can buy milk in returnable glass bottles in order to make my own yogurt and kefir at home. Anyhow, this is an example of a project that is made possible by many digitally dynamic and vanishing paper lists. I think that one excellent way to document this process is to find a way to consolidate these lists into one and show their evolution. </p>

                                <h2>Science Friction, Inter-species conversations, and Plant Perception</h2>
                                <br>
                                <p>Last week I visited CCCB exhibition: Science Friction: Living Among Companion Species. Nuria and Jonathan recommended that we visit as it has a lot to do with topics we were discussing during the Bio and Agri Zero course.</p>
                                <p>The exhibition is asking provacative questions: Is it possible to imagine other earthly stories? Can we conceive of other ways of living among different species? This exhibition explores these issues with the help of a selection of works of art and popular science. It proposes a change of mentality and sensitivity that questions the supremacy of the human species, opting for a view of the world understood as an ecosystem where all the planet’s species coexist.</p>
                                
                                <p>Soon the world will be returned to the healthy intelligences, the collective ones. Colonies and hives.

                                    <br>-Pablo Amaringo</p>
                 
                                <p>At this exhibition, I was taken aback by a video of a scientist, called Baxter, performing experiments on a philodendron plant. The video showed him connecting metal plates that picked up electromagnetic signals on one of the plants leaves. Baxter was explaining how he had sat in the room with a plant and at the exact moment that he began to imagine up how he would kill the plant with fire, the plant reacted with electromagnetic pulses. This was visible as the sensors were connected to an oscillator which drew lines representing the fluctuation in electromagnetic pulses. He set up another experiment on timers and recorded the whole process with cameras so that he could leave the lab and his consciousness would not interfere with the results. He connected the plant to the electromagnetic sensors and oscillator just as before. But this time he set up a tank of boiling water and above it a cup of small fish that would be released into the boiling water when the timer went off. At the moment when the fish fell to their death, the plant reacted with highly irregular and strong electromagnetic pulses.</p>
                                <p>After watching this I was baffled. I couldn't tell if it was real or Hollywood. I mentioned this to Chris because I know that he is very interested in exploring and understanding plant consciousness. After watching the video, which I had recorded on my phone, again with Chris. He confirmed its reality, saying that he also had heard of such or similar experiments. He recommended that I read an article from the New York Times, Do Plants Have Something to Say? One scientist is definitely listening. About Monica Gagliano, an italian-born biologist who claims to receive messages from and create connections with plants. 
                                <p>This article mentions book The Secret Life of Plants by Peter Tompkins y Christopher Bird. Apparently explosively popular when it was published  in 1973, the book makes claims "about plants, including that they enjoy classical music and can read human minds."1 deemed to be pseudoscientific. I began listening to this book on audio this week. I decided to pause, last week's read: This is your mind on plants by Micheal Pollan. </p>

                                <p>I began listening to this book on audio this week. I decided to pause, last week's read: This is your mind on plants by Micheal Pollan. The Secret Life of Plants opens with a chapter on Dr. Cleave Backster's experiments and they describe in detail what I had seen in the video at the CCCB. Some of these experiments were peer reviewed although widely ignored by much of the scientific community. After all, To hypothesize humans are not the only sentient creatures on earth was way out of line with the traditional and religious rhetoric of the time. Backster published a scientific paper titled Evidence of Primary Perception of Plants. I hope to take a closer look at this report. </p>
                                <p>The Secret Life of Plants, although wildly popular, unfortunately was discredited and dismissed by the scientific community. It is indeed pretty kooky. Although I see some of Backster's experiments as repeatable and performed in a credible way, other scientists who were inspired by his work took it to another less proveable level. X performed many experiments that lead him to believe that plants could remember their caretakers and if the caretaker entered into a meditiative state could communicate with them. Although i don't see this as being at all impossible. I can't yet believe it because it can not be proven, rather it can only be experienced. About 4 chapters in, I reached a section about a scientist Lawrence who claims that bio sensors, meaning plants, are more apt to pick up other biological life and signals than any electrical sensor and thus concludes that in order to receive signals from exterrestrial living organisms we must implement the use of bio-sensors instead of electrical gadgets. Although a lot of the book feels logical and not too impossible, it is presented in a way that makes you doubt the all of these scientists findings because there is a lack of detail and scientific explanation. </p>
                                <p>Although this book is hard to believe and many of the experiments mentioned are impossible to prove or replicate, I think the biggest shame is that it scared other scientists researching in this field to continue their work as they feared being compared to these kooks like Backster, Vogel and Lawrence. Monica Gagliano is one of the few scientists today that is bold enough to claim that plants have perception and are sentient beings with memory, language and a sense of direction. Next on my list is her book "Thus Spoke the Plant".</p>
