								<p>Cracked LCD Screen: Everything Else about the Screen seemed to be working.<br><br>
                               The screen was discarded because the screen was cracked and this meant that the image was not visible or heavily distorted. When we turned the TV on at the beginning of the class, we could see the menu on the left side flashing in and out. Along the cracks, we could see colorful lights flickering. When we took off the LCD screen, I was surprised to see how flexible it was! I imagined that the screen would be thick and brittle like glass but that was not the case. LCD stands for Liquid Cristal Display and indeed in between the layers, we found a liquid layer. We broke off a corner of the screen and put it under the microscope and there we could see the individual RGB pixels. </p>

                                <br>
                                <ol><li>Disassembly <br> <br> In order to disassemble the TV, we had to break or damage certain elements. Ideally, we could design electronics that can be disassembled easily without damaging them in the process. This way if one part is broken we can easily take it out fix that one element. This is key for the circular economy to function. Fairphone is a cell phone company that is implementing this concept. However only Fairphone manufactures the elements needed and if they go out of business a customer will not be able to upgrade or swap out a broken part. Instead they will have to go back to buying a phone planned for obsolescence. Perhaps, we could have a universal phone structure where many companies made parts that fit into the overall structure. You could have a camera from apple and a battery from Samsung. Could that be a viable business model for the participating companies?</li>
                                    <br><li>Component mapping</li><br>
                                    The TV had many different electronic boards and most of them had a Vestel logo printed somewhere on the surface.  The board that handled the power had a lot of capacitors, which can store power even if the TV is unplugged and even if it hasn't been plugged it for a long while. In order to release the current  from these capacitors, you have to wear gloves and simultaneously touch their two legs with the end of a screw driver. Next, we identified each board's function and started to note down the names and numbers printed on each black box and did some research into what these black boxes do and where they come from. Guillem and Victor informed us that often times, inside a blackbox you will find other smaller blackboxes. <br><br><li>Circuit mapping</li>Next, we wanted to understand how everything was wired because that would allow us to better understand what signals were sent between which of the 5 panels, LEDs or speakers. We set the elements on the table and physically mapped out where the chords connected. <br><br><li>Testing backlighting (isolated)</li><br>To be sure that all the LEDs were working we attached the wires to a voltage box. With 12 volts we could not perceive any light. This was strange as we had seen that before the TV was working. Using a multi-meter, we checked to see that the LED strips were connected with current. This allowed us to determine that the LEDs were wired in series instead of parallel. Typically lights are wired in parallel because it will require less voltage. Also, if one strip breaks and is wired in series the whole system will stop working. But one benefit of wiring in parallel with a higher voltage is that you can use smaller wires. The higher the voltage the smaller the wire. We can use the analogy of a thin pipe carrying water from one place to another to understand this concept. </ol>

                                <br>
                                <p>Fab for Economics vs Fab for Environment: The traditional mindset about the economic model makes the “cost/benefit” the main purpose of the industry, leaving long term purposes (environment contamination, carbon footprint, recycling and reutilization) aside. The challenge for this type of products is to start producing in a circular economic way.</p>
                                <p>Black Box (TV) has inside black boxes that have inside blackboxes that have inside blackboxes: The understanding about machines that are made of smaller machines, each one with their own utility, is a interesting fact when fixing or reinventing products. In the case of this TV, we had a lot of black boxes that could be used for fabrication of other type of products.</p>
                                <p>The difficulty of disassembling it without breaking it: Disposable products, not made for fixing at home, is a paradigm that is changing. In today´s world the concept of DIY is attached to the way humans and things are related.
                                </p>
                                <p>The industry managed to settle products for different public using the same boards: Low cost and simplificity for production is exemplified, fabricating different models for different public using the same “materials”.</p>
                                <p>It’s not that the TV did not work, it was only the the black LCD screen: Can the client replace the screen?, or is too dangerous?, or is not favorable for the industry?</p>

Supply chains literally stretch across the globe with one product having components being manufactured in Japan, Turkey, Russia, China and Taiwan. And more so, each of these locations having it’s own selection of suppliers with sub-components, sub-sub-components and raw materials that can come from e.g. Africa, South-East Asia or South-America. With likeliness of being cross-distributed between them so that any product produced by this system - on itself - has travelled an insane amount of distance and, in a way, is an encapsulement of the world’s efforts itself. </p>
                                
                                <p>Aside of that we learned that by disassembling a recent model HITACHI television 📺 and web-researching the parts inside that the same PCB (printed circuit board) produced by a single chip-giant can be sold to several (direct market-rivals) electronics-companies and they can sell it to different customer segments by choosing to in- or exclude certain functionalities on the same single PCB. In the case of our HITACHI tv this was shown as the unused outlines of where an HDMI-port would be in a more expensive model of the same brand.</p>
                                
                                <p>I think that for those willing to see it’s clear as day that this one-way-stream system cannot survive longterm and exploits its early layers for the benefits of those at the end.</p>
                                
                                <p>Yes, the consumer has his television and he has it cheap, but at what cost for those that mined its materials and what purpose will it serve next.</p>
                                
                                <p>Our television got to us because its LCD screen was cracked. The LCD screen, just one broken component out of at least ten perfect working parts and still the entirity of the product was discarded. Even with the knowledgement of which component being the infunctional one, since it gave this as visual feedback on the screen.</p>

                                <h2>What was our concept?</h2>
                                <br>
                                <p>Together with Tatiana, Angel, Jeremy, and Gerda, we shared a few ideas that we were all thinking about. Jeremy was interested in using the electromagnet and we came up with the idea of creating a robotic arm that picked up a ball with an electromagnet. We decided to create a loop and figured that we could decorated it in a certain way that could spark emotion or serve as commentary on some phenomenon. I proposed the idea that we put a trashcan at the top so that the magnetic ball that would alway fall into the trash can, fall down a constructed contraption and then get picked up again and the action would repeat infinitely. A bit of the plastic wrapped around the ball and a miniature trashcan could turn the machine from being completely useless to a tongue in cheek representation of what the circular economy is right now, far from the idilic model that we are aiming for. This machine can hint at our cyclical trash cycle. Trash does not disappear when we throw it in the bin, instead it comes back to bite us in a variety of ways. It may pollute our oceans and our fish stock, wash up on our beloved beaches, or get transformed back into a product that will later get thrown away. We came up with the overall idea of the structure, which included a robotic arm that could move the ball from the finish back the start of the contraption. </p>

                                <br>
                                <p>We were interested in adding a human interaction because it would allow for others to engage with the machine. Because we wanted to automate the machine into a loop. The loop would not require human interaction but a button is an easy way for an individual to interact with the machine. When building the track that the ball would fall down we figured that we should create two possible tracks and that the human could choose the trajectory of the ball by pressing the button or not. </p>

                                <br>
                                <p>The coding happened in parallel to the electronics. Jeremy took the lead on this field as he has a lot of experience in mechatronics. He was indeed in his element and together with Tatiana set up the breadboards, soldered some wires, and perfected the logic map needed to write the Arduino code. Because my fabrication skills were needed for the project, I spent my time helping out with that part and did not work at all on the electronics. Through osmosis, I started to understand a bit of what was going on but I need to sit down and look at the code so I can better understand how the machine really works. I would like to develop skills in Arduino but I don't feel a burning need to do so. Because I know next to nothing about coming up with Arduino code, it feels daunting. If there had been more time, I would have liked to sit down with Jeremy to have him explain the process. But I will have to set aside another time to truly learn Arduino, perhaps with a specific project in mind. </p>
                                <br>
                                <h2>Teamwork</h2>
                                <br>
                                <p>I felt that we worked really well as a team and were able to decide on one concept pretty quickly and separate our tasks based on our skills and backgrounds. Gerda and I focused on fabrication. Angel and Tatiana both helped in the fabrication process but Angel also tackled the storyboard and the powerpoint presentation. Tatiana also mapped out the logic map that was crucial for Jeremy to write the arduino code and helped Jeremy with the electronics. Jeremy focused on the electronics and coding as it is his strong suit. Overall, I was very impressed that we got the machine working to the level and running in a smooth loop (with occasional errors in its positioning) in just 3 days. It goes to show how much you can get done with a group of people with diverse skill sets and under a healthy bit of stress and time pressure. </p>

                                <h2>Overall reflections</h2>
                                <br>
                                <p>I have never made a machine before. I have never made anything with so many moving parts. So, in this respect this project allowed me to work in a way that I usually do not. The time constraints also forced us to think of a solution of the fly and use the things you could find around you. I am used to having a lot more time to plan out a project and each step from concept to prototype to final usually is much more methodical. In contrast, a few vague sketches put to paper was enough for us to launch ourselves right into prototyping and this prototype was iterated on and then  become the final project. This quick, on the fly prototyping method allowed us to think through a lot of our material-choices and physical set up in a variety of ways. We were tossing ideas back and forth constantly of how to fix one part or another. Hot glue was our best friend for a while but also we quickly realized that it is a pesty material to remove. </p>
