								<h2>Week 1</h2>
                                 <br>
                                <p>In all honesty, this week was a bit of an overload. I was particularly excited for this class as I am keen on expanding my scientific knowledge because as we learn more about biology and ecology, the lens through which we see the world comes into focus. I was impressed by the caliber of Nuria and Jonathan's professional work and ready to dive deep into what they had to share.</p>

								<p>Like just about any academic course, this class could have been structured in a variety of ways. I don't think that a daily 4 hour PowerPoint presentation that condensed a semester’s worth of microbiology and biochemistry topics into 3-4 days was the way to go. I can say for sure that quite a few of us felt soggy after the deluge of information. In my opinion, it would be beneficial to apply the minimalist mantra to this course, less is more.</p>

								<p>Nuria and Jonathan recommended we watch the BBC documentary: The Hidden Life of a Cell. They use easily digestible language to describe the role of each element of the cell and compare them with our everyday infrastructures such as machines, sorting centers, and highways. I personally, felt that I needed more of the dum-dum explanations so that I could wrap my head around the core processes and not get lost in the detailed diagrams and complex element transfers.</p>

								<p>I think my biggest and most important takeaway was - our planet's biology is incredibly complicated and complex and if I want to incorporate biology into a design intervention in any shape or form I will need to collaborate with someone directly in the field. What we, as individuals might perceive to be true or logical on a surface level, must first be studied repeatedly in controlled conditions before we can understand it to be true. Don't assume anything. First, speak to some scientists.</p>

								<p>Secondly, another important takeaway was that understanding some of the basics behind the research that biologists are doing today can help us to build more respect for scientists and the impact of their research. Years of patient research lead to discoveries that shape the way our health care, agriculture, and ethics today.</p>

								<p>The hands-on activities were key helpful in translating diagrams and concepts into tangible knowledge. We prepared yeast, lactobacillus, and all-purpose media in Petri dishes and gathered bacteria samples from our environment to identify if those types of bacteria were present.</p>
                              
                                <br>
                                <br>

                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <p>For me, the highlight of the course was learning about how to grow your own spirulina and kombucha. As a practiced kombucha grandmother, I have taken care of various scoby mothers over the past 5 years or more. Before moving to Barcelona, I passed on my Kombuchamama to a dear friend in hopes that she will continue to feed her sweet liquids. On the other hand, growing spirulina was totally new to me. Although I knew that spirulina was classified as a superfood, I did not realize the extent of its superpowers. It contains 70% protein when eaten fresh. As Nuria pointed out, we could survive off a diet of spirulina, orange juice, and rice for our entire lives and grow to be healthy human beings. I am now keen to start growing spirulina at home to supplement my smoothies. I will need to start making a call to Organa Spirulina and a visit to the fish store to get a bubbler to keep the spirulina medium homogenous. I think this hands-on session could have been a good entry point to start a presentation on the details of how fermentation happens on a cellular level, an area which I would love to know more about.</p>
                                
                                <p>Before going to class each day this week, I would wake up and begin listening to Braiding Sweetgrass by Robin Kimmerman as I prepared my breakfast and coffee and washed the dishes. The author, an indigenous woman, and professor of ecology explores indigenous wisdom, scientific knowledge, and the teachings of plants. I enjoyed listening to her holistic view of our earth and its relationships with plants. It gave me a chance to zoom out before I sat down to the microscope in class.</p>
                                
                                <p>In the first chapter, she recounts, "One otherwise unremarkable morning I gave the students in my General Ecology class a survey. Among other things, they were asked to rate their understanding of the negative interactions between humans and the environment. Nearly every one of the two hundred students said confidently that humans and nature are a bad mix. These were third-year students who had selected a career in environmental protection, so the response was, in a way, not very surprising. They were well-schooled in the mechanics of climate change, toxins in the land and water, and the crisis of habitat loss. Later in the survey, they were asked to rate their knowledge of positive interactions between people and land. The median response was “none.” </p>
                                
                                <p>This passage left me to ponder our inter-species dependence and the few remaining people roaming the earth that live in harmony with nature. My partner asked me just a few weeks ago, before the master's course began, "how do we communicate and connect with other species?" Taken by surprise, I responded, "We connect with very few species and I personally feel very disconnected to the animal world even though I am part of the animal kingdom. Apart from dogs and cats, of course. But we have modified them through selective breeding to adapt to our ideal lifestyles." I was under the impression that animals and humans were a bad mix and we should probably just let them be and stop interfering with their habitat. But, in just a few weeks I have begun to reform my opinion on the matter as that question has been ruminating within me. There are many living populations today that do live in harmony with other species and these people manipulate the environment in ways that allow other life to thrive. Nonetheless, the average human today has lost the respect and knowledge that is necessary to foster the surrounding ecological environment. Instead, we exploit the earth's riches for our constant short-lived pleasures. How can we turn that around? How can we regain that respect and reverse our irrational destruction and consumption?</p>
                                
                                <p>Robin goes on to mention the complexities of her indigenous language, Potowatomi. Because her culture was displaced and repressed by the colonizing U.S. government, she never spoke the language with her parents but tried to learn it later in life. In contrast to English which is noun-based, Potowatomi is verb-based because every living action has a unique verb to describe it.</p>
                                
                                <p>Robin writes, "Pages blurred and my eyes settled on a word—a verb, of course: “to be a Saturday.” Pfft! I threw down the book. Since when is Saturday a verb? Everyone knows it’s a noun. I grabbed the dictionary and flipped more pages and all kinds of things seemed to be verbs: “to be a hill, ” “to be red, ” “to be a long sandy stretch of beach, ” and then my finger rested on wiikwegamaa: “to be a bay. [...] In that moment I could smell the water of the bay, watch it rock against the shore, and hear it sift onto the sand. A bay is a noun only if water is dead. When bay is a noun, it is defined by humans, trapped between its shores and contained by the word. But the verb wiikwegamaa—to be a bay —releases the water from bondage and lets it live. “To be a bay” holds the wonder that, for this moment, the living water has decided to shelter itself between these shores, conversing with cedar roots and a flock of baby mergansers. Because it could do otherwise— become a stream or an ocean or a waterfall, and there are verbs for that, too. To be a hill, to be a sandy beach, to be a Saturday, all are possible verbs in a world where everything is alive."</p>
                                
                                <p>In English, you would never call a person an "it" but you likely would call a sheep, a tree, or an apple, "it". However, in Potawatomi, you refer to all things pertaining to the earth, as living beings. In learning Potowatimi, Robin learns the grammar of animacy which reframes the way that we see the world.</p>
                                
                                <p>Robin continues, “To whom does our language extend the grammar of animacy? Naturally, plants and animals are animate, but as I learn, I am discovering that the Potawatomi understanding of what it means to be animate diverges from the list of attributes of living beings we all learned in Biology 101. In Potawatomi 101, rocks are animate, as are mountains and water and fire and places. Beings that are imbued with spirit, our sacred medicines, our songs, drums, and even stories, are all animate. The list of the inanimate seems to be smaller, filled with objects that are made by people. Of an inanimate being, like a table, we say, “What is it?” And we answer Dopwen yewe. Table it is. But of apple, we must say, “ Who is that being?” And reply Mshimin yawe. Apple that being is.”</p>
                                
                                <p>If we framed all of our languages like this, perhaps ranchers in the Amazon would think twice before deforesting 50 football fields, and or businessmen might stop in his tracks before blowing up a mountain in Panama to sell the rock for gravel across the globe. This indigenous wisdom has got me thinking about how we might be able to change our behaviors and show more respect to our natural world. How can we bolster environmental consciousness?</p>

                                <h2>Week 2</h2>
                                <br>
                                <p>Agriculture and ecology are subjects that are much easier to relate to because of their scale and presence in our daily life. Although I have never lived on a farm, I have lived in rural areas close to agriculture fields and dairy farms, I have started my own vegetable garden, and have spent time foraging berries, mushrooms, fiddleheads, and Chaga bark in the northeast of the United States. I have become increasingly interested in understanding ecological interactions in order to find more sustainable ways of eating, living, and growing inhabitable environments.</p>

								<p>I was intrigued by Jonathan’s first lecture as he introduced different ways to revolutionize the agricultural industry that included agroforestry and robotic farming. I was first introduced to the concept of agroforestry a couple of years ago by my partner who now is studying Tropical Forestry Management. He presented it as a solution that if done well, has the potential to sequester carbon, naturally control pests, enrich the soil, and reduce water consumption. And naturally, my question was, “So, why aren’t more farmers doing agroforestry?”. Jonathan provided an interesting answer to this -- that very few farmers that the ability to stop what they are doing, rip up their monoculture crops, redesign their system and wait 5-10 years for the agroforest to produce sufficient yields and compete with the market’s demands. Agroforestry addresses many of traditional agriculture’s issues at a systemic level but requires a re-wiring of the whole system. But no one has the money or time for a big renovation because if you shut the system down for one growing season, we’ll have a food crisis and the farmers will go out of business. Instead, we modify our seeds in the lab and soak our spongy soil with fertilizer, these amendments serve as bandaids but require that you smack a bigger more expensive bandage on top every growing season and the wound continues to fester.</p>

								<p>Agroforestry techniques are nothing new, they are practiced around the world by indigenous communities. Julia Watson mentions a few examples in her book Lo-TEK. “The most widely known agroecological system of the ancient Mayan civilization, which remains central to traditional agricultural practices, is the milpa. More than fostering sustainable food production, it is a sophisticated resource management system that has been practiced for millennia.” (p.123, Watson). The Mayans are skilled pyrotechnicians; they burn selected milpas once every 20 years which allows for nutrients to flow and for the soil to rejuvenate due to the charred biomass. The burning also reduces pests and releases certain nutrients such as calcium from the soil and promotes fertility. After burning a milpa, the 20-year growing cycle begins again. The milpas are burnt on a rotational cycle meaning that there are different crops being harvested from different milpas at any given season because they are at different growing stages.</p>

                                <br>

								<p>She also presents a case study of a the Kihamba forest gardens of the Chagga people in Tanzania. “These gardens are dense banana forests, watered by canals to form a lush agroforestry stystem which mimics the natual habitat of the tropical montane forest. A forest garden involves the mangement of multipurpose trees and shrubs in symbiosis with annual and perennial agricultural crops and livestock. The innovation’s ability to scale has sustained the area’s dramatic population rise over the past one hundred years.”(139, Watson)</p>

                                <p>My partner, Igor and I have discussed his research on how agroforestry in the Brazilian Amazon could incentivize farmers to protect the forest by cultivating it intelligently and growing plentiful yields rather than buldowsing it down to turn it into cattle farms and soy plantations could lead to eventual desertification. But let’s be clear, palm oil plantations are not agroforests but rather an example of monoculture and unfortunately the plantation of palm oil groves are becoming popular in Brazil following trends set in south east asia. </p>

								<p>All this talk about agroforestry got me thinking, which countries or regions are having success in transitioning traditional agriculture to agroforestry?And how can we go about implementing and accelerating this transition? One though is to start with micro forests and encourage individuals with land or micro farms to implement these techniques.</p>
                                
                                <p>Jonathan mentioned that he is working on a document that proposes methods for Barcelona to grow a series of micro forests to suppliment the cities food demands. In 2016, in my hometown, Atlanta, Georgia, the Conservation Fund and the city council began planting the country’s largest food forest in a low-income neighborhood of South Atlanta with its nearest grocery store a 30-minute bus ride away and local laws that prohibited the cultivation of food on private lots up until 2014. This project aims to improve its community’s access to healthy foods and vegetables. Atlanta, like much of the United States, suffers from “supermarket redlining” whereby grocery stores do not exist in the low-income black and immigrant neighborhoods and communities are forced to eat at fast food joints and often suffer from obesity and diabetes. The forest is maintained by hundreds of local volunteers and the food is distributed throughout the community. It also serves as an educational space for students to learn about nutrition, and how to cultivate their own food. We can hope that this introduction to urban agriculture will have a lasting impact on the next generation and inspire them to maintain and improve this urban food forest. Although this solution may only make a small dent in the country’s enormous food inequalities, it is having a ripple effect and has inspired other cities to implement similar projects.</p>
                                
                                <p>During the course, Jonathan emphasized that we need to focus on re-farming the farm as opposed to farming the city. He made it clear that he is not against urban agriculture, but rather that we should not underestimate our dependency on the farms outside of the city and often beyond our own country’s borders. To feed New York city inside the cities border you’d have to turn just about every lot into a sky scraper. If we are going to feed the world’s growing population without destroying more habitats and depleting more water systems, we need to become increasingly efficient in how we farm. We need to optimize water usage, minimize exposed soil, improve crop rotation to replenish nitrates and nitrites naturally, grow our farms in layers (e.g. agroforestry), and do away with the diesel tractors and replace them with solar-powered robots.</p>
                                
                                <p>The ROMI project, an EU funded research project to develop robotics for microfarms, is adressing this need. The team is working to develop open-source robots and data analysis software that can help small scale farmers to optimize their yield and minimize human labor. Europe has a lot of microfarms where this technology will be welcomed as microfarms often struggle to increase their yield because there is not enough money to invest in more workers to work the farm, thus the back breaking work is left to few individuals.</p>

                                <p>I enjoyed the soil sample assessment exercise that we did in class. I saw it as valuable on many levels. Analysis of the physical properties (clay, loam, silt, sand, etc.), PH level, nitrate, nitrite and phosphate content is necessary to understand a specific area’s soil composition to determine what will grow well or what is needed to replenish the soil or improve plants’ growing conditions. Additionally, assessment of the physical properties of the soil is useful to determine how it can be used for bio construction or for pottery. </p>

                                <p>As part of a group exercise, we performed a test, feeling the qualities of different soils by needing them, squeezing them and rubbing them between our hands. Through a series of steps we were able to determine whether the soil fit into the following categories.</p>
                                
                                <p>Sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, silt loam, loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay, or clay. Here they are categorized for easy of analysis but in reality -- like most things -- they are points on a spectrum. Because this was the first time most of us had performed this test, we struggled to select our categories but it is obviously something that you get better at with time because your conclusions are based on relation to other soils that you have tested. After testing for the physical properties, we then moved on to testing the PH, nitrate, nitrite, and phosphate levels through chemical tests.</p>

                                <p>I enjoyed the lecture on bees, perhaps the most important keystone species. These intriguing U-social creatures that have captured the intrigue and imagination of many dedicated ecologists and ever since working with Marcella, an ex-colleague and professional bee keeper, I too have been interested to one day care for a colony. In my past job working as a fabrication assistant for a sculpture artist, Marcella and I, the other assistant would chat about her bee-keeping escapades in and around New York City. During the summer, she works full time tending to beehives purchased by individuals and businesses around the bustling metropolis. She would report back to me about the varroa mite infestations that they were struggling to deal with and the harsh winters where the bees would often eat through all of their honey stores and need receive sugar fondant supplements to ensure their survival. During the lecture, I was jotting down notes that I will soon share with Marcella. There are many tips and tricks that beekeepers share but it seems that because the communities are usually grass roots and local that sometimes knowledge on fighting off the mites with a specific enzyme developed by an IGEM team in Israel or a method to boost their immune systems using mycelium doesn’t dissemenitate quickly.</p>
                                
                                <p>Years ago, here in barcelona I recall going to lunch with a few friends, one of whom had found a bee colony nesting in an old electrical box in the interior courtyard of his apartment building. He captured the queen and most of the workers but them in a black box, disorienting them by driving outside of barcelona and back, and then bringing them to a hive he had set up on his terrace. There they stayed and began to produce honey. It seemed at the time like a heroic tale, something that I myself would not have had the thought or guts to do. But now as I gain more know-how on the subject, it seems more and more like a welcomed opportunity.</p>

Here we ripped up the leaves preparing them for the hand made copper aparatus which boils water through the leaves and condenses the steam into laurel infused water and oil. We learned that you cannot injest the laurel essential oils because it contains dangerous levels of cyanide.</figcaption>
