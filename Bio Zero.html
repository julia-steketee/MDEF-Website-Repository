								<p>In all honesty, this week was a bit of an overload. I was particularly excited for this class as  I am keen on expanding my scientific knowledge because as we learn more about biology and ecology, the lens in which we see the world comes into focus. I was impressed by the caliber of Nuria and Jonathan's professional work and ready dive deep in to what they had to share. </p>

								<p>Like just about any academic course, this class could have been structured in a variety of ways. I don't think that a daily 4 hour powerpoint presentation which condensed a semester worth of  microbiology and biochemistry topics into 3-4 days was the way to go. I can say for sure that quite a few of us felt soggy after the deluge of information. In my opinion, it would be beneficial to apply the minimalist mantra to this course, less is more. </p>

								<p>Nuria and Jonathan recommended us to watch the BBC documentary: The Hidden life of a Cell.  They use easily digestible language to describe the roll of each element of the cell and compare them with our everyday infrastructure such as machines, sorting centers and  highways. I believe we needed more of the dum-dum explanations so that we could wrap our heads around the core rolls and not get lost in the structures, diagrams and element transfers.</p>

								<p>I think my biggest and most important take away was - our planet's biology is incredibly complicated and complex and if I want to incorporate biology into a design intervention in any shape of form I will need to collaborate with someone directly in the field. What we, as individuals might perceive to be true or logical on a surface level, must first be studied repeatedly in controlled conditions before we can understand it to be true. Don't assume anything. First, speak to some scientists.  </p>

								<p>For me the highlight of the course was learning about how to grow your own spirulina and kombucha. As a practiced kombucha grandmother, I have taken care of various scoby mothers over the past 5 years or more. Before moving to Barcelona, I passed on my Kombuchamama to a dear friend in hopes that she will continue to feed her sweet liquids. On the hand, growing spirulina was totally new to me. Although I knew that spirulina was classified as a super food, I did not realize the extent of its super powers. It contains 70% protein when eaten fresh. As Nuria pointed out, we could survive off a diet of spirulina, orange juice and rice for our entire lives and grow to be healthy human beings. I am now keen to start growing spirulina at home to supliment my smoothies. I will need to start making a call to Organa Spirulina and a visit to the fish store to get a bubbler to keep the spriulina medium homogenous. I think this hands-on session could have been a good entry point to start a presentation on the details of how fermentation happens on a cellular level, an area which I would love to know more about. </p>

								<p>Before going to class each day this week, I would wake up and begin listening to Braiding Sweetgrass by Robin Kimmerman as I prepared my breakfast and coffee and washed the dishes. The author, an indigenous woman and professor of ecology,  explores indigenous wisdom, scientific knowledge and the teachings of plants. I enjoyed listening to her holistic view of our earth and relationships with plants. It gave me a chance to zoom out before I sat down to the microscope in class. </p>
                                
                                <p>In the first chapter she recounts,  </p>
                                
                                <p>"One otherwise unremarkable morning I gave the students in my General Ecology class a survey. Among other things, they were asked to rate their understanding of the negative interactions between humans and the environment. Nearly every one of the two hundred students said confidently that humans and nature are a bad mix. These were third-year students who had selected a career in environmental protection, so the response was, in a way, not very surprising. They were well schooled in the mechanics of climate change, toxins in the land and water, and the crisis of habitat loss. Later in the survey, they were asked to rate their knowledge of positive interactions between people and land. The median response was “none.”</p>
                                
                                <p>This passage left me to ponder our inter-species dependence and the few remaining people roaming the earth that live in harmony with nature.  My partner asked me just a few weeks ago, before the master's course began,  "how do we communicate and connect with other species?" Taken by surprise, I responded, "We connect with very few species and I personally feel very disconnected to the animal world even though I am part of the animal kingdom. Apart from dogs and cats, of course. But we have modified them through selective breeding to adapt to our ideal lifestyles." I was under the impression that animals and humans were a bad mix and we should probably just let them be and stop interfering with their habitat. But, in just a few weeks I have begun to reform my opinion on the matter as that question has been ruminating within me. There are many living populations today that do live in harmony other species and these people manipulate the environment in ways that allow other life to thrive. Nonetheless, the average human today has lost the respect and knowledge that is necessary to foster the surrounding ecological environment. Instead we exploit the earth's riches for our constant short lived pleasures. How can we turn that around? How can we regain that respect and reverse our irrational destruction and consumption?  </p>
                                
                                <p>Robin goes on to mention the complexities of her indigenous language, Potowatomi. Because her culture was displaced and repressed by the colonizing U.S. government, she never spoke the language with her parents but tried to learn later in life. In contrast to English which is noun based, Potowatomi is verb-based because every living action has a unique verb to describe it. </p>
                                
                                <p>Robin writes, </p>
                                
                                <p>"Pages blurred and my eyes settled on a word—a verb, of course: “to be a Saturday.” Pfft! I threw down the book. Since when i s Saturday a verb? Everyone knows it’s a noun. I grabbed the dictionary and flipped more pages and all kinds of things seemed to be verbs: “to be a hill, ” “to be red, ” “to be a long sandy stretch of beach, ” and then my finger rested on wiikwegamaa: “to be a bay. [...] In that moment I could smell the water of the bay, watch it rock against the shore and hear it sift onto the sand. A bay is a noun only if water is dead. When bay is a noun, it is defined by humans, trapped between its shores and contained by the word. But the verb wiikwegamaa—to be a bay —releases the water from bondage and lets it live. “To be a bay” holds the wonder that, for this moment, the living water has decided to shelter itself between these shores, conversing with cedar roots and a flock of baby mergansers. Because it could do otherwise— become a stream or an ocean or a waterfall, and there are verbs for that, too. To be a hill, to be a sandy beach, to be a Saturday, all are possible verbs in a world where everything is alive." </p>
                                
                                 <p>In English, you would never call a person an "it" but you likely would call a sheep, a tree or an apple, "it". However in Potawatimi, you refer to all things pertaining to the earth, as living beings. In learning Potowatimi, Robin learns the grammar of animacy which reframes the way that we see the world.</p>
                                
                                 <p>To whom does our language extend the grammar of animacy? Naturally, plants and animals are animate, but as I learn, I am discovering that the Potawatomi understanding of what it means to be animate diverges from the list of attributes of living beings we all learned in Biology 101. In Potawatomi 101, rocks are animate, as are mountains and water and fire and places. Beings that are imbued with spirit, our sacred medicines, our songs, drums, and even stories, are all animate. The list of the inanimate seems to be smaller, filled with objects that are made by people. Of an inanimate being, like a table, we say, “What is it?” And we answer Dopwen yewe. Table it is. But of apple, we must say, “ Who is that being?” And reply Mshimin yawe. Apple that being is. </p>
                                
                                 <p>If we framed all of our languages like this, perhaps ranchers in the Amazon would think twice before deforesting 50 football fields and or business men might stop in his tracks before blowing up a mountain in Panama to sell the rock for gravel across the globe. This indigenous wisdom has got me thinking about how we might be able change our behaviors and show more respect to our natural world. How can we bolster environmental consciousness?  </p>
