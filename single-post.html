                            <p>Week 1 Reflection
I have recently been reading Against White Feminism where Rafia Zakaria speaks at length about so many failures of humanitarian aid projects. For instance, the Gates Foundation's project to provide clean burning stoves to rural villages in India that no-one knew how to fix and that prevented women from socializing while collecting wood. 
These types of interventions would have been done very differently had they been done from a 1st person perspective with designers in the community working in collaboration with them. 
I have yet to design from a 1st person perspective. Infact, up to this point all of my designs have been from a 3rd person perspective, as I have been working in traditional sense, creating designs that I hope others will find intriguing, want to buy, share their space with or continue to click around. 
One of the main reasons that I decided to do the master's program is because I have been looking for ways to design from within a community. I've had my fair share of designing and making expensive things for rich people to consume. I seek to design for a wider audience or one that I see as more valuable than the 1%, whom already have a huge pool of designers designing with them in mind. I want my design practice to pay respect  to our complex and intricate ecosystems through their material composition and construction methods as well as, consider diverse communities, cultures and ways of life. 
We did an exercise to illustrate who we are are and how and where we want to be . This was incredibly fruitful as it allowed me to put my past and future into a cohesive context. In my final year of university, our class was asked to come up with a 5 year plan. Attitudes, ethics, or strengths were not used as guiding factors for the exercise. And although valuable in its own right, the exercise led to students listing things they wanted to do but not who they wanted to be. 
I see this as a clear red flag giving warning to how design eduction is traditionally taught across the globe. We need not put more thought into Why we want to design. We need to ask: "Why do I want to start a business?" or "Why do I want to go to architecture school?" Is it simply because that is how we measure order, progress, and success?
The exercise we did this week has allowed me to map out both my personal and professional attitudes, skills, knowledges, and possible futures and recognize how each are more linked than I had previously imagined. It also inspired me to map out my past & present interests and try to draw connections that help to contextualize my design practice and hopefully guide me this coming year. Drawing the through-lines and mapping out a network of ideas feels like a crucial part of staying grounded. 
Thinking about my design practice as a network, a lattice, or a woven fabric of ideas helps me to find place in a world of interconnected ecosystems, cultural, social, economic and technological webs. Interests do not arise out of a vacuum and they are not completely separate thoughts. 
I believe that the stronger and more diverse / plural our networks are, the more intelligent, resilient and grounded/humbled we will be. </p>
