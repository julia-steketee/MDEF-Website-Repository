                                <br>
                                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GU4mBDBim18</p>
                                <p>I have been feeling a bit frustrated with the lack of time I have had to actually excecute any of the ideas that have been brewing in my head. During the first month of classes we were dropped into a sea, littered with insights, ideas and influences. I was flailing, grabbing on to several of these different elements at once trying to select which is best suited for me. I grasped a large one, thinking it will be adequate to keep me afloat  but then let go, switched gears and latch on to another attracted by its shape. Realizing its not big enough, I then swam to snatch another that might be more bouyant and supportive of my weight. In the sea, different floating ideas keep getting added to the mix and i feel overwhelmed by my choices.</p>
                                    
                                <p>I felt strongly that I need some time to stop and start developing the ideas that i had tumbling around inside of me. First I have assembled some questions that are on my mind.</p>
                                
                                <ul>

                                    <li>How can we have a dialogue with plants? How can we inspire others to open up to this conversation?</li>

                                    <li>How can we build knowledge and interest about bio-construction methods within the city? Will people be able to apply these methods in an urban context?</li>

                                <p>But when thinking about an idea that I could implement from a 1st person perspective, I made a list some things, skills, and knowledge that I would like to build in order to bring me closer to exploring some of the broader questions above. On wednesday evening I jotted down some possible interventions,</p>

                                <br>
                                <p>After waking up and going for a quick stroll, I decided to go for one of the first ideas that came to my head. it had obviously stuck with me over night: set up a circular system in the apartment. Apart from water, fuel, and energy, begin to re-use everything that I would recycle or dispose of. Create a storage system.</p>
                                
                                <p>I saw this idea an opportunity to embark upon a new lifestyle, one that I have thought about experimenting with but have struggled to muster up the courage and determination to do so. This idea also encompasses many other ideas on the list above. Because I will have to re-use my food residues, I will need to...
                                    <br> <br>
                                    start a home compost with worms

                                    set up a a biomaterial work station and storage system. 
                                    This includes building a some molds and a solar powered dehydration box to dehydrate food residues.

                                    With the plastic waste that I collect, sort and shred, I can explore one of the question from my list above. </p>
                                <p>9. Can we make our trash turn into a regenerative structure using mycelium that digests plastic?</p>
                                <p>Around 9am, I kicked off my new lifestyle and started washing, sorting and shredding the recyclables from my bin.<br> <br> My first impressions were: </p>
                                
                                <ul>
                                <li>I was using a lot more water that I would usually and I needed to reduce the water consumption of the cleaning process.</li>
                                    <br>
                                <li>I was using a lot more water that I would usually and I needed to reduce the water consumption of the cleaning process.</li>
                                    <br>
                                <li>I needed a shredder to make the paper shredding and plastic shredding easier.</li>
                                    <br>
                                <li>I should take my hard plastics to IAAC where I could use the Precious Plastic shredder.</li>
                                    <br>
                                <li>A lot of the flexible plastics in my recycling bin are not labeled with what type of plastic they contain.They almost all had a symbol indicating that I should throw them into the yellow (plastics) recycling bin but in reality these soft plastics will likely not get recycled, but rather burned.</li><br>
                                </ul>
                                <p>My next step was to sanitize, dry and grind up food residues that I had collected. I also needed to sanitize old glass jars to store the ingredients. <br> <br>
                                    My impressions were: </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>sanitizing the food waste and jars meant that I was using more water and gas than I would normally. Perhaps the best method would be to gather large amounts of foodwaste and sanitizing in bulk quanities in order to optimize the use of water and gas.</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>I was drying my food waste in the toaster oven which was consuming lots of electricity. I needed to build a solar dehydrator so that I could complete this step without upping my energy consumption.</li></ul>
                                <p>Later on I went scavenging for fallen leaves for my compost and materials that I could use to build a solar dehydrator and molds for my bio materials. I found a used electric heater that I would later hook up to a solar panel and a box with slots for shelving. Later I would add shelves, a back panel and a front door and connect the heating system into the bottom in order to create a convection current inside. </p><br><br>

                                <p>This adventure is a personal study to become  more aware to the types, amount, and variety of materials that we consume and discard. Without this awareness, we will continue to purchase, use and discard in excess. This excercise will also have direct consequences on the way that I buy and consume. More than ever before, I will actively refuse plastics at the supermarkets and seek out stores that sell in bulk quantities and allow you to bring your own containers.</p>

                                <p>It will force me to take responsibility for all of what I consume instead of putting it on the shoulders of someone else. For example, I will have be certain that everything that I am throwing into the compost will degrade in a timely manner. Big chunks of food should be chopped up, egg shells should be pre-crused, and lemon rinds perhaps should be avoided since they require a lot of time to be digested. 
                                
                                <h2>3. to eliminate the idea of waste and dismantle our linear system</h2><br>
                                <p>On a general level, this new lifestyle will help me eliminate the idea of waste. It will allow me to explore new uses for used objects or food scraps. There is so much talk about the circular economy these days. It is obviously more important to approach this shift from an industrial level since the largest quantities of waste are produced in large companies, factories and institutions. But this experiment takes the approach of circular economy as a much smaller scale, although my individual impact is small, this excericise allows me to understand the complexities of such a system, embody the spirit of the circular movement and change my perception of the status quo. </p>
                                
                                <h2>What happens when you involve yourself? What happens when you use yourself as an instrument?</h2><br>
                                <p>Typically when we approach design briefs, we focus on a final result. By putting yourself into the project, we shine light on the process and our journey becomes more important that the final result. You become part of the design and you become the novelty. This project felt a bit like a performance piece, and it turns you into a character. But despite being able to adopt a new persona, it can reveal or amplify vulnerabilities or character traits that you might not always perceive. It is also important to ask, am I the right person to pursue this project or should I being choosing a project that is more suited to my personality, background and context? Involving yourself in the project can also leave you too invested in the result and sensitive to criticism of the project. You can no longer separate yourself from the project because you are part of it.</p>
                                <h2>Did anything change about your way of working? What does it mean for your future work?</h2><br>
                                <p>One of my favorite parts of this assignment, was that it gave me a reason to set aside all the other distractions, assignments, and social obligations of my day, only to focus on my idea. With a life of juggling work, studies, and social engagements, it felt refreshing to put aside my computer, not respond to my messages, and flow with ideas and activities. I just kept a notebook close by where I would add to my to-do list and note down my impressions. Going forward, I would like to set aside more of this focused time. Over time, I have realized that I am a terrible multi-tasker but when working on one thing I can reach a deep focus. for this reason, I need to work on finding chunks of time, clearing my slate, and focusing on one idea for a while so that I can accomplish more, and be fully present while designing and working. </p>
                                
                                <h2>After seeing the videos of your collective, how does it change your understanding of it, present new opportunities or inspire new possibilities for collaboration?</h2><br><p>I have been spending time with the bio-tech-ancestry group where we have discussed the need to focus on designing for planetary mutualism, developing ways to communicate with or harvest energy from plants, embody the experience of other living organisms, and how to grow almost anything. I joined this group because i was interested in inter species collaboration, indigenous TEK and Lo-tech or ancestral technologies. I felt that my interests spread out between a few different groups: solar punk, post consumerism and the bio-tech-ancestry group. I am still very interested in the topics discussed in this group but I don't think I yet know exactly how to approach a topic that sits nicely in this triangle. As my project this week deals explores topics such as circular economy, zero waste, and composting,  I think it probably fits better into post-consumerism or solar punk. However, I don't feel that this project even begins to touch on the breadth of my interests. I think that it might be beneficial to speak to others from other groups to see how our interests align but I also want to explore other interests that might be more aligned with my bio-tech-ancestry collective such as interspecies collaboration, mycelium, bio architecture, and building structures that support or serve as sensors for humans to communicate with and understand ecosystems.</p>

                                <p>This activity encouraged us to think on the fly and make something that evoked an idea. I began without any clear idea in mind. I simply grabbed the plastic white scraps in front of me and started to assemble them in the cardboard box that I had found on the street. The white recycled plastic created a marble effect that reminded me of marble stairs and as I spontaneously layered each strip one upon the next, I felt that I was creating a sort of organically inspired marble palace. The thin striated steps reminded me of the baleens of a whale. As I created this unfamiliar palacial sanctuary, I felt that I individually did not deserve to own this space. It felt wrong to call it my home, instead I felt that I should perhaps dedicate it to the soil samples that I had analyzed the other day in our Bio Agri Zero class. I mounted their hammock which in retrospect is perhaps ironic and purely symbolic, given that nature’s chosen bed is the earth, rich in organic material, and not a cloth hammock. But nonetheless, I decided to work with familiar humanistic imagery and icons whilst radically uprooting the centerpiece of the traditional altar cabinet commonly used across various religions. Instead of a iconic god, or martyr, sits 3 soil samples and a selection of laurel leaves, gifts from Gaia, our beloved Pachama. This may be billions of people today, but to many of the original peoples, mother earth, whatever her form or name, was and is the most respected and worshiped figure.

                                <p>Our group came up with physical representations of a variety of ideas. Not all directly related to the discussion we had in class but like just about everything, it all leads back to a common thread. Joaquin built an interactive musical instrument. Chris constructed a soil dowser -- two intersecting sticks that find soil instead of water. Fiorella conceived a network that harvested plants’ energy and connected her to the system with wireless LED earrings. Nikita fashioned a slip-on prosthetic penus that could allow people to experiment with and normalize gender fluidity. Didac assembled a lamp that only lit when its scale was in equilbrium, serving as a metaphor for our society’s imbalances. I can’t say that all of these projects fit smoothly into our bio-tech-ancestry triangle but we definitely all explored topics of ethics and the connection with other humans, other earthlings, and the earth.</p>
