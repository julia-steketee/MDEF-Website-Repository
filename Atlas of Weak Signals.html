								<p>The Atlas of Weak Signals card deck has boosted my vocabulary, helped me to categorize my interests and make connections between seemingly disparate concepts. I feel that my interests resonate with so many of the weak signals. On the other hand, I clearly did not resonate with all of them and it was a helpful exercise to knock off signals that, although I may care about, are not core to who I am or want to be as a designer and as a professional.I feel that my interests lie along this spectrum: Ecology - Indigenous TEK - Regenerative Design - Bio-Architecture - Bio-Materials - Material Literacy - Re-use and Refurbishment - Circular Economy </p>
                                
                                <p>I feel that my interests lie along this spectrum: Ecology - Indigenous TEK - Regenerative Design - Bio-Architecture - Bio-Materials - Material Literacy - Re-use and Refurbishment - Circular Economy </p>

								<p>Regenerative Design
                                To the hike, I brought along a light pack, some fruits, and one weak signal : Regenerative Design. I brought this signal because I felt that it lies somewhere in the middle of my spectrum of interests and its expansive meaning allows for a wide range of applications, from green roofs, to permaculture farms, to beehives, to houses that operate exclusively on renewable energy.</p>
                                
                                <p>Wikipedia gives the following definition: "Regenerative design is a process-oriented whole system approach to design. The term "regenerative" describes processes that restore, renew or revitalize their own sources of energy and materials. Regenerative design uses whole systems thinking to create resilient and equitable systems that integrate the needs of society with the integrity of nature." </p>

								<p>Indigenous TEK
                                This summer I read Julia Watson's book Lo-TEK, which opened my eyes to many architectural, infrastructural, and agricultural technologies that today are typically dismissed as being primitive while in fact, they are prime examples of regenerative design. They go beyond just sustaining the land and their society but these technologies revitalize ecosystems. Take for example Maasai peoples in Kenya who reverse desertification by migrating through the Maasai Mara National reserve. They are accompanied by cattle who eat Acacia berries and excrete fertile, seed-filled manure along the route. This leads to the growth of acacia trees along these migratory routes. </p>

								<p>Lo-TEK also provides examples of communities who construct their homes using bio-architecture techniques and build as a community. The Uros people from Lake Titicaca in Peru live on floating islands made of peat, Eucalyptus and Totora reed. A top these floating structures, they build their homes, boats, and objects from the Totora reeds. Similarly, the severely threatened Ma'dan people of Iraq's wetlands construct islands from reeds and mud and build complex and elegantly designed homes, schools, and religious spaces on top. Working only with the limited variety of natural resources in their immediate surrounding, these communities exemplify resourceful innovation. </p>

								<p>Ancestral FuturesAnother argument for the need to take a step back in order to take a step towards a more regenerative future, is that the ancestral and indigenous technological innovations exclusively require energy and resources that occur naturally in the local environment. None of the examples from Lo-TEK require electricity, heavy machinery or a temperature controlled laboratory. As we try to establish renewable off the grid electricity to rural communities in the global south, I think we should also work to recognize and bolster existing bio-architecture, organic agriculture, indigenous water systems, and natural wastewater treatment technologies. In many cases we can use these ancient technologies as inspiration to prevent desertification, treat waste water, and sustainably extract ground water in other places in the world that are not already using these technologies or have have dismissed this native traditional ecological knowledge. </p>
                                
                                <p>Bio-Architecture
                                I have always been enamored by architecture, interested to enter the field,  but always a bit overwhelmed by its scale. Reading Lo-TEK brought my architectural interest back to the surface as it introduced me to various examples of bio-architectural structures built as a community. This community style of building reminds me of the way that Amish men in the United States assemble houses as a community without heavy machinery and over the course of a few days. These communal methods require no electricity, build muscle and solidarity, and  empower the spirits of the individuals involved. A lot of the Bio-architecture projects across the world implement this community spirit. This week I dug myself into a rabbit hole, exploring the various bio architecture projects going on in Brazil. Because of the plentiful natural resources and wide variety of fibrous plants and bamboo species, Brazil provides an incredible site for bio-architecture projects. Johan Van Lengen, a dutch architect worked extensively in Latin America and established the bio-architecture school Tibá. In 1981, he published The Barefoot Architect, which serves as a manual for green building practices appropriate for tropical practices.  Much of what he has documented in the book are indigenous methods of building. Similar to the Mexican government, who put a copy of the book in every library across the country, I see this publication as endlessly valuable. In an ideal world, every community could find a manual for sustainable and regenerative building practices that use exclusively local materials. This would help architects and contractors to be able to work within the means of the planet's limited resources. </p>

								<p>On Saturday, I went to ConnectHort and volunteered on BAM's bio-architecture project. The small house used to sit outside of MACBA, the contemporary art museum and provided an intimate venue for music events. I later found out that my friend whom I am renting a flat from used to DJ inside the Hay, bamboo, and wooden room. When the contract with the Ajuntamiento came to a close, ConnectHort offered to accomodate the structure. It had to be partially dismantled in order to wheel it across town but is now in the process of being re-constructed. I worked cutting, hammering, and flattening splitting bamboo shoots which we then nailed to wooden structures that we will later fill with hay and cover with clay. Others sifted dirt, and mixed it with water to prepare the clay for the outer layer of the walls. Here, I connected with two friends, Francesco and Flavia, two architects whom I had met previously but was happily surprised to re-connect with. Flavia told me about her past work with Canyaviva, a bio-architecture organization that has completely majestic organic structures across the Iberian peninsula and beyond. If I am not mistaken, they built a covered space for a concert venue at Primavera Sound, in Barcelona.</p>
