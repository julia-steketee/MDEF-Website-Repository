                                <p>Roberto and I joined forces as we were both interested in mycelium but got excited about it for different reasons. Roberto had been very interested in its ability to digest plastics and I was got interested in mycelium as a sustainable fabrication material.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h2>Our first design intervention</h2>
                                <br>
                                <p>I whipped up a poster for the workshop. In the background you can see a microscopic image of the mycelium hypae! We wanted to structure the workshop around the two things that got us interested in mycelium - its ability to bioremediate and its potential as a sustainable fabrication material. ConnectHort seemed like the right spot as it is a meeting point for people interested in ecology and bio-construction. </p>
                                
                                <p>To kick start the workshop, we welcomed everyone with a oyster mushroom snack. Harvested from a substrate that we purchased from Bolet de Soca, a supplier of spores and inocuated substrate here in Catalunya. To begin, we introduced some of the wonders of the fungi kingdom. We opened this part up for discussion an encouraged people to shout out any facts that they knew about mushrooms, molds, or mycelium.  <br> Some of these fungi facts include: </p>
                                
								<p>Forest communication and health:  (wood wide web, symbiotic relationship with plants and trees, pairing with crops can increase yield or change taste)<br><br>
Medicinal purposes: (penicillin, psilocybin, neurogenesis, better immune system, prevent cancer)<br><br>
Culinary: (high nutritional value, from truffles, to shiitake, to oyster, etc.)<br><br>
Natural insecticide, Pest control: (for termites and ants patented by Paul Stamets)<br><br>
Compost (Fungi include molds and yeasts, and collectively they are responsible for the decomposition of many complex plant polymers in soil and compost. Fungi are the digestive system of the forest.)<br><br>
Bioremediation: (digests a number of toxic materials)<br><br>
Fabrication material: (insulative, strong, nonflammable and hydrophobic)<br><br>
Can find the path of least resistance and solve a maze: (Tokyo train system)<br><br>
Biofuel (Paul Stamets)</p>

                                <h2>Let's get familiar with some vocabulary...</h2>
                                <br> 
                                <p>Mycelium: the mass of interwoven filamentous hyphae that forms especially the vegetative portion of the thallus of a fungus and is often submerged in another body (as of soil or organic matter or the tissues of a host)<br><br>
Fruiting bodies: the mushrooms above the surface of the soil or organic material<br><br>
Spores:  A small, usually single-celled reproductive body that is resistant to adverse <br><br>environmental conditions and is capable of growing into a new organism, produced especially by certain fungi, algae, protozoans, and nonseedbearing plants such as mosses and ferns.
Substrate: the surface or material on or from which an organism lives, grows, or obtains its nourishment.<br><br>
Inoculation: the process of adding mycelium spores into a substrate</p>

                                <h2>Bio-remediation and Myco-remediation</h2>
                                <br>
                                <p>What is bio remediation?<br><br>

Merriam Websterâ€™s dictionary defines it as the treatment of pollutants or waste (as in an oil spill, contaminated groundwater, or an industrial process) by the use of microorganisms (such as bacteria) that break down the undesirable substances. Myco-remediation is bio-remediation by the use of fungi. <br><br>

How do fungi bioremediate?<br><br>

Many types of fungi are able to feed off of lignin, present in trees. Others feed of cellulose. In brief, as fungi eat their substrate they excrete enzymes (e.g. lactases?). These enzymes act as catalysts and speed up the breakdown of the long polmer chains of plastics into monomers or hydrocarbons into their single elements. You can also train fungi to eat certain toxins instead of a different, prefered substrate. They will adapt their behavior depending on their environment and available food supply. <br><br>
                                    Which species of fungi can Myco-remediate?<br><br>

Roberto and I dove into scientific articles and found a variety of species that have been found to decompose different toxic materials. After spending a good amount of time researching, I came to the conclusion that surely there are many more species that have this remarkeable ability but we simply have not done sufficient research. We found around 20 different species that can bio-remediate different types of toxins. Many researchers are now trying to figure out how to design the ideal environment for the fungi to speed up this process to deal with the scale of our plastic, pesticide, and pollution problems.  I assembled a card deck of all of the toxin eating fungi species and during the workshop we set up a activity. On the table lay samples of different types of toxins. We passed out the cards and the participants were tasked to read the bit of information on the card and try to guess which of the toxic samples the fungi species can digest. This deck is downloadable by scanning the QR code to the right. Below, you can see each toxic substrate and their corresponding myco-remediators. 
</p>
                                <p>Can you try a myco-remediation experiment at home?<br><br>

Yes! Roberto and I have started our first myco-remediation experiment from home and we welcome others to try it out at home. But the results will propably turn out best if you have an incubator or make a DIY incubator, such as a small tent or a bag where you can maintain high humidity and a 25Â°C temperature. We are using the DIY tent incubator at IAAC. Humidity is very important for the fungi to grow well. Keep in mind that some incubators are not humid enough. 

From RobertoÂ´s kitchen we prepared a potato dextrose agar medium and then, to each petri dish sample we added substrate where oyster mushroom mycelium was growing and a piece of LDPE plastic (from a plastic bag). In other petri dishes we added oxo-biodegradeable plastic (these plastic bags are often petroleum based plastics with added ions that catalyze their degradation). See the instructions below for details. The most important step is sanitization. Our air is full of microbes and spores, so try to be quick when opening the santized petri dish. We want the desired fungi strain to grow and not other unwanted and unknown molds. They may interefere with the growth of the species that myco-remediates.</p> <br>

                                <h2>But Fungiâ€™s wonderous abilities do not stop at bio-remediation. We havenâ€™t even started to talk about their potential as a sustainable material to replace leather, insulation, or acoustic panels.</h2> <br>

<p>I set forth in a search to understand how designers, engineers, artists and architects are using mycelium in their practices. I compiled a deck of cards that show some of the most successful example of how individuals, collectives, universities and companies are learning how the material behaves and in many cases pushing its natural tendencies to a new limit. You can download the cards by scanning the QR code to the right. </p> <br>

                               <h2>So after seeing all these examples of people using fungi you might be asking, how can I use it too? </h2> <br>

 <p>I have been asking myself that very question for some time now. I have been hearing everyone go on about mycelium as a new revolutionary bio material and I figured I should try to grow it in order to understand what all the fuss was about. I started by purchasing a substrate from a dutch company called Mycelium Materials Europe. They create their own substrate from sawdust and a mycelium strain which unfortunately, they would not reveal to me. When the substrate was shipped to me it was active and ready to use. I made my first mold about a week after its arrival, even though idealy I should have used it right away. I kept it in my fridge the whole time to slow down its growth but they explicitely say that you shouldnÂ´t wait more than a month because it will loose its ability to grow as fast and dense as it should to be used for a design application. When Roberto and I started to fill new molds to prepare for the workshop but because the substrate was over a month old and after the recommended 7 days growing time the molds still did not grow to be dense and white on the exterior. </p>
                                
                                <p>If you are interested to purchase a pre-inoculated substrate from Mycelium Materials Europe, Grown Bio, or Ecovative you can use the instructions below to guide you. These instructions as well as the instructions to try out a myco-remediation experiment are available to download by scanning the QR code below. </p>
