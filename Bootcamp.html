								<p>I have recently been reading Against White Feminism where Rafia Zakaria speaks at length about so many failures of humanitarian aid projects. For instance, the Gates Foundation's project to provide clean stoves to rural villages in India that no locals knew how to fix and dismantled the women's collective routines of collecting wood and sharing news and information. These types of interventions would have been done very differently had they been done from a 1st person perspective with designers in the community working in collaboration with the women who use the stoves.</p>

								<p>I can't say that I've ever designed from a 1st person perspective. In fact, up until now all of my designs have been from a 3rd person perspective. I've creating furniture, products and artistic pieces that I hope others will find intriguing, want to buy, share their space with. One of the main reasons that I decided to do the master's program is because I have been looking for ways to design from within a community. I've had my fair share of designing and making expensive things for rich consumers. I seek to design for a wider audience and one that is more representative of the world's diverse population. The 1% of the world already has a huge pool of designers ideating and fabricating with them in mind. I aspire to develop a design practice that pays respect to our complex and intricate ecosystems by means of material choice and construction methods and in turn, considers diverse communities, cultures and ways of life.</p>

								<p>This first week, we were asked to illustrate who we are are and how and where we want to be. I found that outlining my skills, knowledge, and attitude very fruitful as it allowed me to put my past and future into a cohesive context. In my final year of university, our class was asked to come up with a 5 year plan. Attitudes, ethics, or strengths were not used as guiding factors for the exercise. And although valuable in its own right, the assignment led students to list things they wanted to do but not who they wanted to be. I see the 5-year plan exercise as a red flag giving warning of how design eduction is traditionally taught across the globe. We need to put more emphasis on why we want to design. We should ask ourselves: "Why do I want to start a business?" and "Why do I want to go to architecture school?" Is it simply because that is how we measure order, progress, and success?</p>

								<p>This week's exercise has allowed me to map out both my personal and professional attitudes, skills, knowledges, and possible futures and recognize how each are more linked than I had previously imagined. It also inspired me to map out my past & present interests and inspirations and draw connections to help contextualize my design practice and hopefully guide me over the coming year. Drawing the through-lines and mapping out a network of ideas feels like a crucial step to stay grounded. To make sense of all the seemingly disjointed inputs, influences and information, I have tried to weave my skills, knowledge and attitudes into a woven fabric. As I build upon these traits, my network will strengthen.</p>

								<p>Our world is comprised countless interconnected ecosystems, cultural, social, economic and technological webs. The stronger and more diverse our networks are, the more intelligent, resilient and humble we will be.</p>

								<p>Poblenou Urban District provides a vibrant example of how numerous members of a community can join together to build a strong creative network across a neighborhood that had in many ways been forgotten and abandoned. La Plataforma, TransfoLab, BiciHub, and ConnectHort are organizations in Poblenou that emphasize the need to build strong relationships and that celebrate sharing knowledge across the community and beyond. La Plataforma organizes an Open Day across dozens of Poblenou's creative studios and galleries for visitors explore the refreshed spaces and see numerous artists work on display all within a short walk from one another. </p>

								<p>TransfoLab provides a workspace for members to refurbish furniture and make new pieces out of local trash and residues. BiciHub provides rentable space for the public to fix their bikes and classes to learn about repair basics. ConnectHort is a community garden that allows volunteers to take part in composting, gardening, and bio-architecture projects. They also host music and culinary events open to the community for a  fee. These organizations are designed for the citizen and could not run without the community's interest, co-operation and collaboration.</p>
