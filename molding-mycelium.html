                                <h2>How can I mold mycelium into a form?</h2>
                                <br>
                                <p>I have learnt so much about mycelium over the past few years and I really want to better understand what all the fuss is about.  This summer I met two dutch designers, Jesse and Victor who work for Mycelium Europe in the Netherlands. They were working on a project trying to experiment how they could use one of the biproducts of the lab, a fine dust composed of  mycelium and the sawdust substrate, to create a new material. I found out that their company sells a sawdust substrate that is impregnated with mycelium spores that is avaiable to order. This an excellent way to start molding with mycelium because they have perfected the recipe so that the mycelium will grow into the shape of the mold in 5-7 days and require 1-2 days to dry. The mycelium material must be baked in the oven at 93 degrees celcius for 30 minutes to kill the fungus. Them the piece is ready to use and will be able to support weight and repel water. I was hoping to ind a company like this one in Spain so that I could order it locally. I did some research but found no one. Then I asked Jesse if she knew of any other mycelium substrate manufacturers and she said that Mycelium Europe and Grow.bio are the only ones in Europe. Grown.bio is also based in the Netherlands. I decided to go ahead an purchase some substrate from Mycelium Europe.</p>
                                
                                <p>It came in the mail in a massive box. I picked it up from a DHL drop off location, a shop that sold Moroccan jelabas. They were stunned that I was going to walk home with such an enormous box all by myself. It was a bit precarious but I made it back home. The vaccuum sealed mycelium block only occupied about half of the enormous boxâ€™s cavity. I loaded it directly in my fridge because I needed to prepare the mold before I could start working with it. The mycelium needs to remain in the fridge if it is not going to be used immediately, otherwise the warmer temperatures will activate it and cause it to keep growing.  </p>

                                <h2>Preparing the mold and gattering the materials</h2>
                                <br>
                                <p>After reading some info on the internet, I found out that it is essential that when working with mycelium everything has to sanitized. Any unwanted bacteria that gets into the mold can ruin your whole project. Alcohol and gloves were added to the list of supplies.</p>
                                
                                <p>Next, I took a trip to the Elisava workshop where I purchased a piece of blue foam to sculpt into the desired shape. I came up with a design pretty quickly as I knew that this mold was going to be my first test. I decided to make a shape that could serve as a module in a plant wall installation. I made a I found a old piece of plywood on the street that I would use on the back side of the mold.  I biked up town to Complas where I purchased a 1m2 of Polistyrene sheet plastic that would be moldeable on the Formtech vaccum former. The vaccum former heats up the plastic and the bed shoot up while air is sucked out and the plastic forms over the inserted shape.  One side of my mold was completed. To finish off the other side, I cut out an inside chunk of the blue foam and attached it to the plywood panel. </p>

                                <h2>Filling the Mold</h2>
                                <br>
                                
                                <p>First, I sanitized everything that I needed for the procedure. Scissors, mold, surfaces and all! I took out some chunks of mycelium and then resealed the bag and put it back in the fridge. </p>
                                <p>I needed to break the mycelium chunks into small pieces or rather a fine uniform dust. Unfortunately, this process took an incredibly long time. Next time, I will santitize my blender and chop some of the bits up in the blender before inserting the material into the mold. Because the material I put in the mold still had small chunks it meant that I could not get a solid and compact surface because there were some airspaces between the chunks and the mycelium would not fill those spaces. The mold must be completely sealed but you must poke a few airholes about 2-3 cm apart so that the mycelium can get some oxygen. I poked the holes before filling the mold. Once filled, I left in a dark space for 7 days. </p>

                                <p>After 7 days, I was confident that the mycelium had grown sufficiently. I could see white foamy growth through the air holes. Carefully, I removed the form from the mold and laid it out to dry for 2 days. </p>
